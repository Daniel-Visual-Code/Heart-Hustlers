        <h1>Sudden Cardiac Arrest in Student Athletes</h1>
        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>Sudden cardiac arrest is rare but serious in student athletes. It's often caused by hidden heart conditions and can strike without warning during intense activity.</p>
        <p> Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a life-threatening emergency that can strike even the healthiest individuals—including student athletes. Each year, approximately 100 to 150 young athletes experience SCA, and among NCAA athletes, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading medical cause of death, accounting for 13% of all athlete fatalities over a 20-year span.</p>

    <p> Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a life-threatening emergency that can strike even the healthiest individuals—including student athletes. Each year, approximately 100 to 150 young athletes experience SCA, and among NCAA athletes, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading medical cause of death, accounting for 13% of all athlete fatalities over a 20-year span. 

    Immediate CPR can double or triple survival chances, but survival drops by 10% for every minute without intervention. Despite this, only 40% of cardiac arrest victims receive bystander CPR. When CPR is administered quickly, nearly 80% of survivors experience favorable neurological outcomes. 

    Certain groups face even higher risks: </p>

    <li>athletes are 4x more likely to experience SCD than females </li>

    <li>Black athletes are 3x more likely than white athletes </li>

    <li>NCAA Division I mens basketball players face a 1 in 2,000 risk over a four-year career </li>

    <p>
        Encouragingly, the incidence of SCD among NCAA athletes has decreased by 29% every five years, thanks to improved CPR training, wider access to AEDs, and better cardiovascular screening. 

        For student athletes, CPR training isn’t just a precaution—it’s a vital skill that can save a teammate’s life. Promoting CPR awareness and preparedness in schools and sports programs is essential to protecting young lives on and off the field.
